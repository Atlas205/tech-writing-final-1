            Dnd is one of if not the biggest roleplaying game with multitudes of ways to play
            using characters customization and different campaigns
            which make it so it's very different each time you play
        </p>

        <br>
        <div class="races">

            <p>
                For the characters you have everything from regular humans to dwarves, elves and even dragonborn each
                one adds
                its own
                features from boosting your stats too giving racial features

                Humans boost all stats by one unless you're using variant which boosts one by two and two by one while
                also
                giving a
                feat which I will get into later

                Dwarves give a bonus to constitution by two and depending on the subrace another bonus they also give
                racial
                features
                such as dwarven resilience which boosts your health by one whenever you level up

                Elves give bonuses to dexterity being plus two and charisma plus one they also do not need to sleep in
                game they
                only
                need to meditate and they cannot be put to sleep with spells and they get dark vision which acts like
                night
                vision
                goggles with no color

                Dragonborn boost your constitution by 1 and strength by 2 and the racial feature is a breath weapon
                which is an
                ability
                that you can use once per long rest which depending on your dragon's color can be ice and fire and even
                poison

            </p>
        </div>


        <p>
            There are even more races but that’s too many to cover now we can move unto stats
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <p>
            The main stats are constitution which affects your health how well you can defend against poison and also
            how
            well you
            can drink, dexterity affects how well you can move and how precise you can move but also your hit chance
            with a
            ranged
            weapon, strength affects how much you can carry how much you can move and how much damage you can do with a
            sword,
            wisdom is your ability to tell where architecture comes from or just good judgement, intelligence is how
            much
            you know
            how well you can use certain spells, charisma is how well you can convince people of something be it making
            a
            guard let
            you pass by complimenting them or threatening them or any other way you can convince people
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            For the rest of character customization there's
            the classes which have the biggest effect on how you play there's a
            bunch so I will go over the most used ones
        </p>



        <p>
            Fighters are the most commonly used class being also one of the simplest to play as they do not have any
            magic
            abilities
            as they tend to rely on their main weapon and their ability to have the multi attack feature

            Rogues are one of the most broken classes because they have a ton of features for lessening the damage they
            take
            from
            attacks and they have sneak attack which gives a bonus to attack depending on your level

            Warlocks are cultists they worship dark gods such as the fiend or the old one which give them features
            depending
            on
            which one you choose and they get magic which tends to be very powerful but they can only use it at their
            max
            level
            which means you run out of uses fast but deal a lot of damage
        </p>

        <p>
            There's plenty of more but I recommend researching those on your own
        </p>


        <br><br><br>

        <p>
            Now the campaigns there's plenty of campaigns to choose from which can range from easy to nigh impossible
            depending on
            which one you're running such as an example of the one of the hardest campaigns would be tomb of horrors
            which
            players
            and dms tend to refer to it as a meat grinder its full of tricks and traps which will most likely get you
            unless
            you’ve
            memorized the entire campaign by heart but there's also easier campaigns such as the one that comes with the
            starter set
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <p>
            Spells are a core feature in dnd being used by almost every class with few exceptions they can range from
            the
            cantrips
            which are the weakest but you can use almost infinitely all the up to the most powerful ninth level spells
            which
            can
            change the game completely such as the wish spell which does what it says it grants the players wish but it
            can
            have a
            twist depending on the DM
        </p>
