    <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>

    <h3>html</h3>
    <p>
        Html is the base of making a website almost like the brain,
        and it controls what is shown on the actual webpage to whoever is viewing it and it makes it so there's buttons
        and links on the page
        and makes sure they are clickable so that you don’t just have a thing that looks like a button but does nothing
    </p>

    <p>
        which is why you need html tags which are something that defines what type of thing you are writing
        so if you use a
        "p" tag then it means you are writing a paragraph or if you're using a
        "h1" tag that means you're writing a header
        at its largest size which is useful when creating titles for different subjects on your webpage The thing that
        goes in the tags are
        html elements which is everything inside of an html tag it is what actually shows up on your website
    </p>

    <p>

        if you have a "p" tag whatever you put in it will show up like a paragraph meaning it will show up
        as if you're just typing in word or a notepad or if your using
        "h1" tags it will show up as a header which means it will be by itself and bigger than the paragraph text
        so it actually stands out so people know if it’s a different section or not
    </p>

    <p>
        but typically most coders use "h3" tags for titles but the main title of the page will be an
        "h1" tag which can be used with a block element which is a group of similar things
        connected to each other in a space that separates it from other content on your page to keep it nice and clean
        to look at
        and keeps it organized keeping all similar content stuck together and in line with each other properly
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>css</h3>
    <p>
        a CSS rule is the basics of CSS which allow it to change how a website looks,
        CSS controls what everything looks like in your webpage As well as helping
        keep everything organized and helps people decide what they should be doing on your website
        by highlighting things with distinct colors, giving animation to certain things such as the background,
        it also helps with what people think when there on your website by using specific colors to match what type of
        thing you're going with
        and what type of business you are,
    </p>

    <p>

        if you’re a bank for say then you might want to go with greens and grays and
        if you’re something related to like hockey then you might want to go with different shades of blue and grays
        cause people will associate certain colors with certain things or emotions the main job of css belongs to
        CSS selectors which works similarly to the html tag or it works with it is the code that changes how an html tag
        looks
        by selecting it and then applying all your styling code too it that you put in the style version of the tag as
        long as the html page
        is connected to where you put your CSS because it can both be in your html page which is inline style or it can
        be in its own page
        which means the html page has to be linked to the CSS code page so it can actually take affect
    </p>
