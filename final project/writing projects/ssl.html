        <p>
            SSL stands for secure socket layer;
            it is the standard for keeping a secure internet connection and it safeguards any sensitive data from people
            trying to take it,
            what it does is encrypt the data that is being sent,
        </p>

        <p>
            but if you want a more secure up to date version you should go with Transport layer
            security which is the updated version of SSL and does its job better but most people
            will refer to TLS as SSL because it is the more common term,
            If you're looking for a secure website it should have https instead of http If it is,
            it means it is secure and SSL is being used to protect the information sent and received (if it is secure)
            all the information you send will be encrypted when sent and once it is received by the proper device it is
            decrypted
            so that it can understand it and so can the people who might need to read and go through it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Encryption is a way to protect your information if you're sending anything or even receiving it will change
            what
            is there
            while its being sent to what would look like a bunch of random numbers and letters so if someone is trying
            to
            steal it,
            they won't know what it says you would want to do this for Any information that is personal or confidential
            because if any information like that got out it would be a problem especially for you
        </p>

        <p>

            if your personal information got out the person who took it could use it to drain money from you
            commit fraud and various other crimes that could then lead too you and cause massive problems for you in
            your
            daily life
            that’s why always check if it has http or https though It depends on what you're doing on the internet
            because if you're just browsing through images and playing games like snake it would be fine to have it as
            http
            but if you're going on your bank account or if you're looking at your email then it should absolutely have
            https
            because if it doesn’t your personal information could be at threat of being taken and used,
            you should want it to be https anyways because it is the safer option
            but if you are on a site that is asking for your personal information such as your phone and bank
            check if it is https and take precaution.
